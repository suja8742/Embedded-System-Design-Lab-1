# Embedded-System-Design-Lab-1
Contains all the work completed for Lab 1 of Embedded System design. It consists of the .PLD file and .SI file for the Atmel WinCupl program written to both, simulate and load the SPLD chip, the example code written to program the MSP432, the assembly program written on Emily52 for 8051 and the schematics of the development board PCB that I worked on for the week. Check branch master for the same.
